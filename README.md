# The Lead Scoring Case Study was expertly conducted by Bindu N and Bhavana M_Upgrad
X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, receives numerous leads daily from website visits, forms, and referrals. However, their lead conversion rate is only 30%. The goal is to improve this by identifying 'Hot Leads'—those most likely to convert—so the sales team can focus their efforts efficiently. The task is to build a model that assigns a lead score to prioritize high-conversion leads, with a target conversion rate of around 80%.

A lead scoring case study was conducted using a logistic regression model to align with the business requirements and provide predictive insights into lead conversion.
